With so many wonderful ways to self-publish these days, one hardly needs a "personal website". But I've had one since 1996 and each has been a great tool for self-expression and a low-risk place to experiment and keep my digital skills sharp. This one is no exception.

It's a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) made with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) to replace the old WordPress site. It uses [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) as a content delivery network and 
[Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) as the origin making the site extremely fast and secure. And it costs less than £0.20 a month to host.

I considered using one of the many, beautiful free themes out there but (embracing the DIY spirit) decided to design and code my own. It uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (for custom CSS), and [ACE](https://github.com/yosssi/ace) templates. It deploys in seconds using [S3sync](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd-sync). The type is good ol' [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Helvetica).

All the code is open source and kept on [GitHub](https://github.com/peterkappus/hugo-pk).

Thanks for visiting!
