2005


In 2005 while living in Seattle, I had the good fortune to meet one of Jenny Holzer's assistant, Abigail Guay, and journalist <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/authors/1124/brendan-kiley" target="_blank">Brendan Kiley</a> at a party. We discussed our mutual obsessions with words, syntax, and semantics, and quickly determined to make an art piece together.

Branded as a "Performance endurance art piece", Brendan took on the persona of "Senator Buddy" and spoke continuously for fourteen hours while I transcribed selected chunks of his speech into some custom software that transformed the words into large-scale typographic projections covering one wall of the gallery space.

We had dozens of attendees and vowed never to do it again.
