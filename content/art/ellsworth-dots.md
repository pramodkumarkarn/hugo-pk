An abstract homage to one of my favorite hard-edge, minimalist painters, Ellsworth Kelly. This piece is based on a photo of Kelly's "<a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=74985&roomid=5318" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.tate.org.uk']);" target="_blank">Méditerannée</a>". This work reinterprets the colorful rectangular blocks of the original 1952 piece as circles in gently shifting colors. It maintains the feel of the original composition while imposing a strict yet playful mathematical order onto the piece.
