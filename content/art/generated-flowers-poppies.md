While staying at a friend&#8217;s home in Seattle, there was a drawing of poppies in a vase which hung over the bed. Every evening and every morning I would look at the drawing and I started to think about how to recreate it in code. Using very simple mathematical formulae to control randomness of size, placement, and curvature of the &#8220;stems&#8221;, I created a program which automatically creates bouquets of poppies. Like their natural counterparts, each one is special and unique. [Contact me](/contact) if you&#8217;re interested in buying a one-of-a-kind print.
