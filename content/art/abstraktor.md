Swaggering gallantly (but relatively ineptly) into the worlds of mathematics and biology, ABSTRAKTOR is a vaguely authoritarian, non-gendered art collective (of one) using algorithms, pattern, and selective mutation to explore the limits of mechanised human expression.

In other words, an excuse to make pretty things with code.
