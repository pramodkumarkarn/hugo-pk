**Okay**, here's the deal...

This site uses [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) to help me figure out which content is most helpful, and if the changes I've made to the site are making it easier to use. It leaves a small "cookie" on your browser so I can tell if you come back and visit again. It also uses your IP address to (attempt to) figure out what country you live in. 

The "_Share this_" links on the [blog](/blog) don't involve any javascript or any tracking (they're all hand-coded regular ol' links). That said I can only imagine what Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn are doing with your data once you get there... but that's something for you to take up with them directly, I suppose.

If you fill in my [contact form](/contact), I hope you'll be good enough to supply a name and an email address so that I can reply to you.

That's it. If you're curious what data I hold on you, just [drop me a line](/contact) and ask.

Thanks for stopping by! [Read more](/colophon) about this site.
