Watching The CountÂ <a title="Counting Video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l7KbMVdN7E" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);" target="_blank">count various objects</a> was one of my favorite pastimes as a child. The sight of his pale purplish skin, wire monocle, crazy eyebrows, teeny fangs, and massive hook nose combined with the his maniacal laughter always made me squeal with delight. I know he played a key role in steering me towards my geeky adulthood and I owe him something of a debt&#8230; To honor the man behind the count, I give you this modest homage in Sesame Street colors.</p>
