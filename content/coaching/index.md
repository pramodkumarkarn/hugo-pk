## Helping technology teams to deliver with joy and excellence.

<!--As the old proverb says, "Nothing succeeds like success." -->
Humans are hard-wired to learn and improve. Whether individually, as a team, or an entire organisation, I love finding latent talent and developing it into something remarkable.

I bring energy, patience, and creativity to my teaching style in a way that elegantly breaks down complex concepts and provides simple, supported, ways to experiment, practice, and grow.
