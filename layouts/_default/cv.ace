        p.top A versatile, innovative, delivery and code-as-craft coach, I've spent the past 20 years helping technology teams to excel at what they do.
        p I've helped teams to break apart legacy monoliths into modern high-performing applications. In the process, we've migrated their codebases to modern toolchains, improved their branching and merging strategies to streamline their workflows and automated everything in their control to reduce build times from days to minutes.
        p I've invited teams to explore BDD & TDD to speed up regression testing and prevent gold-plating. I've introduced pairing and peer reviews (with Pull Requests), code-jams, and mob-programming to build shared understanding and enhance skills across entire teams. 
        p Finally, I have a strong foundation in Agile Coaching and UX/Service Design principles. Improvement is a continuous journey. I look forward to exploring it with you and helping to ensure that your teams not only build the right thing, they build the thing right.
